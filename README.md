# Configure emacs using Org-mode

This repo suggests a way to configure emacs using org-mode. Just use
this repo as your `~/.emacs.d` to get started. All of your
configuration should be written in [emacs.org](blob/master/emacs.org).

## Acknowledgement

This workflow is greatly inspired from [Joost Diepenmaat's setup](https://github.com/joodie/emacs-literal-config).
