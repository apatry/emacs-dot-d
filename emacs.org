#+TITLE: A litterate programming approach to customize emacs
#+AUTHOR: Alex Patry

* Introduction

  This file is used to customize emacs to my needs. The pattern is to
  add one section per type of configuration and then make sure that
  all modules and configuration are defined in it.

  The organization of this file is greatly inspired from Joost
  Diepenmaat and the code he shared at
  https://github.com/joodie/emacs-literal-config.

  If you want to use this structure yourself, the easiest way to get
  started is probably to clone this repository and move it at
  =~/.emacs.d=. Make sure that no file is named =~/.emacs= as it would
  be used instead of =~/.emacs.d/init.el= when emacs is starting.

* Prologue

  Before we start actually configuring our environment, let's define
  some utilities that will help us get organized:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Initialize the package module
    (package-initialize)
     
    ;; Add all the package repositories that we want to use.
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
                 '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)

    ;; Reloading the list of packages takes time, we will do it at most
    ;; once. This variable will be true if the list has already be
    ;; reloaded.
    (setq my/package-refreshed nil)

    ;; Install a package if it is not already installed.
    (defun my/install (package)
      ; install the package if it is not already installed
      (unless (package-installed-p package)

      ; make sure the package index is up-to-date
      (unless my/package-refreshed
        (package-refresh-contents)
        (setq my/package-refreshed t))

      (package-install package)))
  #+END_SRC


* Color theme
   
   I am a big fan of the dark version of the [[http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized][solarized theme]]:

   #+name: look-and-feel
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (my/install 'solarized-theme)
     (require 'solarized-theme)

     (load-theme 'solarized-dark t)
   #+END_SRC

* Python

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (my/install 'python)
    (my/install 'sphinx-doc)
    (my/install 'sphinx-mode)
  #+END_SRC

* Epilogue

** Custom values

  Let's store custom values in a dedicated file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
    (load custom-file)
  #+END_SRC
